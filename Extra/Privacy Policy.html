            another user. The following actions constitute inappropriate uses of Feedback: (a) threatening to leave negative or impartial Feedback for another user unless that user provides services not included in the original Posting or not agreed to
            as part of the Service to be provided; (b) leaving Feedback in order to make the SERVICE PROVIDER or SERVICE USER appear better than he or she actually is or was; and (c) including conditions in an Offer or Want that restrict a SERVICE PROVIDER

            SUCH FEEDBACK OR TAKE ANY ACTION IT DEEMS REASONABLE WITHOUT INCURRING ANY LIABILITY THEREFROM.<br><br><br><br>The foregoing lists of prohibitions provide examples and are not complete or exclusive. ServiceLagbe reserves the right to (a) terminate
            your access to your Account, your ability to post to this Website (or the Services) and (b) refuse, delete or remove, move or edit the content, in whole or in part, of any Postings; with or without cause and with or without notice, for any

            messages that you are allowed to send to other users to a number that ServiceLagbe deems appropriate in ServiceLagbe's sole discretion. ServiceLagbe may report to law enforcement authorities any actions that may be illegal, and any reports
            it receives of such conduct. When legally required or at ServiceLagbe's discretion, ServiceLagbe will cooperate with law enforcement agencies in any investigation of alleged illegal activity on this Product or on the Internet. ServiceLagbe
            does not and cannot review every Posting posted to the Website. These prohibitions do not require ServiceLagbe to monitor, police or remove any Postings or other information submitted by you or any other user.<br></p>

ServiceLagbe may use encryption, passwords, and physical security measures
            to help protect your personal information against unauthorized access and disclosure. No security measures, however, are 100% complete. Therefore, we do not promise and cannot guarantee, and thus you should not expect, that your personal information
            or private communications will not be collected and used by others. You should take steps to protect against unauthorized access to your password, phone, and computer by, among other things, signing off after using a shared computer, choosing
            a robust password that nobody else knows or can easily guess, and keeping your log-in and password private. ServiceLagbe is not responsible for the unauthorized use of your information or for any lost, stolen, compromised passwords, or for
            any activity on your Account via unauthorized password activity.<br></p>

            (i) ServiceLagbe reasonably believes that disclosure is necessary in order to comply with a legal process (such as a court order, search warrant, etc.) or other legal requirement of any governmental authority, (ii) disclosure would potentially
            mitigate our liability in an actual or potential lawsuit, (iii) reasonably necessary to enforce this Privacy Policy, our Terms of Use etc. (iv) disclosure is intended to help investigate or prevent unauthorized transactions or other illegal
            activities, or (v) necessary or appropriate to protect our rights or property, or the rights or property of any person or entity.<br><br><br><br>2.INFORMATION DISCLOSED TO THIRD PARTY SERVICE PROVIDERS AND BUSINESS PARTNERS<br><br>We may contract

            to click on your request on such third party site, and will be directed to our Website where they will have access to your contact details (Partial or complete), as would any other service provider on our Website interested in bidding on your
            request.<br><br><br><br>4.DISCLOSURE TO OTHER USERS OF OUR WEBSITE<br><br>If you are a Service Professional, the information that you post (other than your payment information) is available to other users of our Website and our Services. Comments

            users of the Website and/or Services to such Successor.<br><br><br><br>In addition, in the event of ServiceLagbe's bankruptcy, reorganization, receivership, or assignment for the benefit of creditors, or the application or laws or equitable

            Profile." You must promptly update your personal information if it changes or is inaccurate. Typically, we will not manually alter your personal information because it is very difficult to verify your identity remotely. Nonetheless, upon your
            request we will close your Account and remove your personal information from view as soon as reasonably possible based on your Account activity and in accordance with applicable law. We do retain information from closed Accounts in order to
            comply with the law, prevent fraud, collect any fees owed, resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems, assist with any investigations of any Registered User, enforce our Terms of Use, and take any other actions otherwise permitted by law that
            we deem necessary in our sole and absolute discretion. You should understand, however, that once you publicly post a Request, Offer, Want, Feedback, or any other information onto the Website, you may not be able to change or remove it. Once

            service with a Registered User, receive an offer on your posted service from a Registered User, or have posted a service, ServiceLagbe may send a notice to you or the appropriate Registered User that includes your Full Name. Thus, if you associate
            your real name with your Full Name, the people to whom you have revealed your name may be able to personally identify your Website activities.<br><br><br><br>2.USING INFORMATION FROM ServiceLagbe<br><br>The Website facilitates your sharing

            offered through the Website.<br><br><br><br>3.ACCOUNT PROTECTION<br><br>Your password is the key to your Account. When creating your password, you should use unique numbers, letters, special characters, and combinations thereof. In addition,
